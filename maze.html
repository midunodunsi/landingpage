  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the Maze 3D Game project! This project is a simple 3D maze game built using raycasting techniques. It allows you to navigate through a maze in a first-person perspective, using keyboard controls to move around and explore the environment.</p>

  <h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
  <p>This project uses the following dependencies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL):</strong> A cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware. `Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)` is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components. Software developers can use it to write high-performance computer games and other multimedia applications that can run on many operating systems such as Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. SDL manages video, audio, input devices, CD-ROM, threads, shared object loading, networking, and timers. SDL2 is a powerful library that simplifies the process of creating graphical applications. It provides functions for handling windows, rendering graphics, and capturing user input.</li>
    <li><strong>SDL2_image:</strong> An extension library that enables loading and saving images in various formats.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Raycasting:</strong> Raycasting is a rendering technique used to create a 3D perspective effect in 2D environments. It involves casting rays from the player's viewpoint and calculating intersections with objects in the scene to determine what is visible.</p>
